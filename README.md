# Microsoft Cortana Revival
A reimplementation of the legendary Microsoft Cortana.

# What is this
This is a reimplementation of Microsoft Cortana, a discontinued virtual assistant from Micrsoft. It's not really a reverse-engineering of Microsoft Cortana, however, a replication of the virtual assistant.

# But, why tho? Cortana was crap.
Simply put, it's nostalgic and I have too much time on my hands.

# How do I use it?
You can either download the source code and upload it to a web server, or you can just use it at buttonstinks.cc/cortanarevival.github.io
